MICROMOUSE: THE GREAT CHEESE HUNT is a new Micromouse competition which does not replace Micromouse but is a different companion competition. 
The "CHEESE HUNT" is an event in which an autonomous robot "mouse" searches a maze for a 940 nm IR Beacon (the Cheese) placedin an location 
unknown to the mouse, finds the Beacon, extinguishes it (eats the Cheese), and returns to Start. 

This repository contains Technical Bulletins which describe the competition, design and construction of the BEACON, and 
design and construction of MOUSE SIM, the IR Detection add-on to a traditional Micromouse. The repository contains the BEACON Code, 
and MOUSE SIM Code. The BEACON and MOUSE SIM codes are explained in Tech Bulletin #1. Additional design and code details are given 
in subsequent Bulletins.
